# bot-data
This folder contains some bot data that is used by the SkyKings bot.

Most data on the bot is stored in a database, but we decided that putting the data here on GitHub would be the best choice.

You may use this data for whatever you want, with no restriction.

| File | Description |
|:----:|:-----------:|
| `bit-prices.json` | A list of every item on the bit store. |
| `enchants.txt` | A list of every enchantment and their maximum values. |
| `item-aliases.txt` | A list of aliases used by the SkyKings bot. | 
| `items.txt` | A list of items and their IDs. |
