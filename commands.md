# Commands
SkyKings has a ton of commands that you can use. Here's a list of them all.

Note: Do not literally type `<>` and `[]`

## How to Read
Optional: `[foo]` means that this argument can be ignored.

Required: `<foo>` means that you must use this argument for the command to work
  
Many: `<foos...>` or `[foos...]` means that you can specify more than one. 
  
Multi-word Arguments: If you wish you use an argument with more than one word, use "double quotes" to let the bot you know what you want. Most of the time, if a multi-word argument is at the end of a command, this is not necessary.
